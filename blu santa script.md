Hello everyone… Blu Santa here!

I would like to ask you something that many parents and children worry about.

Doctor, people say a child with Type-1 diabetes can’t live a normal life — that they’ll always be limited in play, food, and daily activities. Is that true? Can a Type-1 child still enjoy childhood and dream of a bright future like any other kid?

Thanks Doctor, that’s very helpful to know.
Doctor, many people believe that once a child starts insulin, they become dependent on it forever. Some even think insulin can harm organs like the kidneys. Is there any truth in this?
